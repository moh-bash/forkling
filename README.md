> 🦎 **Hey, I'm Forky** — an axolotl who lives inside this project. I'll be your guide as you look around.  
> Axolotls regenerate limbs when they lose them, which felt fitting for a tool about forks and lineages. Anyway — let's dig in.

Forkling is a deep-dive tool for open-source repos — health scores, contributor networks, issue triage, and more. It also has a section for browsing open-weight LLMs, in case you're picking a model for your project.

**Live app:** https://forkling.vercel.app/

## 🧡 What Forky can show you

- **Repo Explorer** — search any GitHub org or `owner/repo` and get the full picture: health score, contributor bus-factor, a code-ownership network graph, commit/issue analytics, and a "good first issue" triage panel. Forky's favorite part — this is where you find out if a repo is actually worth your time.
- **Compare** — line up to 3 repos side-by-side (stars, forks, license, health, activity)
- **Open-Source LLM Explorer** — a leaderboard of open-weight models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and more), filterable by license, size, and context window
- **Contributor Guide** — a plain-language path for anyone making their first open-source contribution — Forky wrote this one specifically for first-timers, so don't be shy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 + Vite |
| Routing | React Router 6 |
| Styling | TailwindCSS 4 (`@theme` design tokens) |
| Visualization | D3.js (network graph) + Recharts (trend charts) |
| Data | GitHub REST API + Hugging Face Hub API — no backend, no server-side code |
| Caching | IndexedDB (1-hour TTL response cache) + localStorage (user settings) |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

> *Forky: setting this up takes about two minutes. Here's the whole thing.*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/forkling.git
cd forkling
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs entirely client-side. You don't need any API keys to try it out, but you'll hit GitHub's unauthenticated rate limit fast (60 requests/hour). To raise that to 5,000/hour:

1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) — no special scopes needed for public data
2. Open the app's **Settings panel** and paste it in — it's stored only in your browser's `localStorage`, never sent anywhere except directly to GitHub's API
